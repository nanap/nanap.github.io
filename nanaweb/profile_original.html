	<h2>Falk Benke</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome to my Webpage. My name is <strong>Falk Benke</strong>.
		<br>
		I was WWWWWWW born in Koethen in 1985. This is a small town in the eastern part of Germany.
	</p>
	<p> 
		I studied Business Information Systems at the Berlin School of Economics and Law and worked at IBM as a student employee for three years. 
		<br>
		My master study at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam allowed me gain a deeper understanding of Informatics and Software Engineering.
		This is where I also gathered my first teaching experiences tutoring a class on theoretical computer science.
	</p>

	<p>
		I got in contact with the Berlin startup scene for the first time, when I worked as a student in a small startup taking care of quality assurance. 
		<br>
		I learned about designing innovation in a very hands-on year-long university project in corporation with Stanford University, SAP and Audi called ME310.
	</p>
	<p>
		I enjoy all kinds of activities, like hiking, cycling, bouldering, dragon boating and traveling.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>		
		Right now, I am a <mark>Technology Fellow</mark> at 
		<a href="http://www.meltwater.org" target="_blank">MEST</a>. 
		I will be teaching the 2015 class and am really looking forward to it.<br>
		These are the Tech Fellows this year. 
		As you can see, we are from all around the globe.
