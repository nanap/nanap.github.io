				<p>
					Born on 24th June, 1987 in Accra the capital of Ghana, I have spent most of my life there studying science, engineering, aviation and entreperneurship, read all about me.
					Adenta, a surburb of Accra has alwas been my home. It was there, I built my first motoried car battery powered car.
					It was in this same suburb I first tried out a computer, and its been amazing ever since I laid my hands on it.<br>
					<br>
					In my spare time, I design mechanical parts using AutoCad, Mechanical Desktop or Autodesk Inventor.
					Check out my website that talks about my design and CAD instruction company <strong><a href="http://www.mextacad.getafricaonline.com/">here...</a></strong><br>
					<br>
					During my free or spare time, I love to play with my little siblings or go running and swimming in a swimming pool in the university I attended. Read More about that University in the next webpage on Education & Experience.
